Snell's Law – Explanation & Formula
📌 What is Snell’s Law?
Snell’s Law describes how light bends (refracts) when it passes from one medium to another, such as from air to water or glass to air. It explains the relationship between the angles of incidence and refraction based on the refractive indices of the two materials.
